# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in the repo.
# You can use multiple names like
# *       @kenvilar @ken-vilar @ken.vilar
*       @kenvilar

# Order is important. The last matching pattern has the most precedence.
# So if a pull request only touches javascript, php, and css files, only these owners
# will be requested to review.
*.js    @kenvilar
*.php   @kenvilar
*.css   @kenvilar

# You can also use email addresses if you prefer, for example..
# languages/*  kenvilar@gmail.com
